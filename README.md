# Python-To-AQA-Pseudocode

Original version by gbaman

(forked from gbaman/Python-To-AQA-Pseudocode)

A simple, hashed together converter written in Python for converting Python code to the AQA Computer Science Pseudocode recommended syntax.

This was written initially for my own program so some parts may not work, please feel free to fork and make changes (and create pull requests).

It is very far from perfect but will work for simple to medium complexity programs   

The program is written in Python 3.7.

The supported pseudocode specification can be found in the repository root folder.


## How to use

1. Download and run `py-pseudo.py`
2. Choose Option 1 when prompted and enter the file name of the file you wish to convert (must be in same folder as `py-pseudo.py`).
3. Enter the output file to write to (usually I use `out.txt`).
4. **CHECK THE PSEUDOCODE GIVEN!**
5. ???
6. Profit

## Example

The file used to test this is `test.py` in the repo root.
